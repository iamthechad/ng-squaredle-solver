  <p>This application is designed to help with solving Squaredle puzzles.</p>
  <p>
    Squaredle is a daily word puzzle that can be played here:

    This application is based very heavily on the existing solver at

    >. All of the actual logic to determine available words for a particular board originated from this project.
  </p>
  <p>
    Based on the above logic, I created a new version that cleaned up a few minor issues I had with the original version. Thinking this might be a fun project to learn new things with, I'm using
    Angular with Material for the UI. The project uses NX for the monorepo structure, GitHub Actions for CI build/deploy and is hosted on AWS using CloudFront.
